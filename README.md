# Portfolio

As a passionate data scientist, I leverage R, Julia, and Python to tackle diverse analytical challenges through a variety of personal projects. My portfolio showcases my ability to extract insights from complex datasets, build predictive models, and create visualizations that drive decision-making. From exploring spatial trends to optimizing production forecasts, each project reflects my commitment to blending statistical rigor with innovative coding solutions. Below are key examples of my work, demonstrating proficiency across these  tools and applications.

**Projects**:

+ [Ecological Trend Analysis (R)](https://provanik.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Cash_out_betfair.html): Analyzed 10 years of biodiversity data using R’s tidyverse and ggplot2 to identify species population trends, visualized with interactive Shiny dashboards.
+ [Stock Price Forecasting (Python)](https://provanik.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Analisi_cascina_tripoli.html): Built a LSTM neural network in Python with TensorFlow to predict stock prices, achieving a 15% improvement in RMSE over baseline models.
+ [Epidemic Spread Simulation (Julia)](https://provanik.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ShapeMi.html): Developed a high-performance SIR model in Julia to simulate disease spread, optimizing parameters with DifferentialEquations.jl.
