abstract = {Expanded use of exercise heart rate recovery (HRR) has renewed interest in the pathophysiology of heart rate control. This study uses basic physiologic principles to construct a unique model capable of describing the full time course of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity during HRR. The model is tested in a new study of 22 diverse subjects undergoing both maximal and submaximal treadmill exercise. Based on this analysis, prolongation of HRR involves changes within the sinus node, changes in sympathetic function, in parasympathetic function, and in the central mechanisms regulating autonomic balance. The methods may provide unique insight into alterations in autonomic control in health and disease.},

    abstract = { Although attention has been given to the prognostic implications of changes in heart rate during exercise,1–3 the prognostic value of the rate of decline in heart rate after the cessation of exercise has not been well characterized. The rise in heart rate during exercise is considered to be due to the combination of parasympathetic withdrawal and sympathetic activation.4 The fall in heart rate immediately after exercise is considered to be a function of the reactivation of the parasympathetic nervous system.5 Because increased vagal activity has been associated with a reduction in the risk of death,6 we hypothesized that the .\&nbsp;.\&nbsp;. }

abstract={Heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure variability (BPV), and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) provide important information on cardiovascular autonomic control. However, little is known about the reorganization of HRV, BPV, and BRS after aerobic exercise. While there is a positive relationship between heart rate (HR) recovery rate and cardiorespiratory fitness, it is unclear whether there is a relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and reorganization of cardiovascular autonomic modulation during recovery. Thus, this study aimed to investigate whether cardiorespiratory fitness influences the cardiovascular autonomic modulation recovery, after a cardiopulmonary exercise test. Sixty men were assigned into groups according to their cardiorespiratory fitness: low cardiorespiratory fitness (LCF{\thinspace}={\thinspace}VO2: 22--38 mL kg−1 min−1), moderate (MCF{\thinspace}={\thinspace}VO2: 38--48 mL kg−1 min−1), and high (HCF{\thinspace}={\thinspace}VO2{\thinspace}>{\thinspace}48 mL kg−1 min−1). HRV (linear and non-linear analysis) and BPV (spectral analysis), and BRS (sequence method) were performed before and after a cardiopulmonary exercise test. The groups with higher cardiorespiratory fitness had lower baseline HR values and HR recovery time after the cardiopulmonary exercise test. On comparing rest and recovery periods, the spectral analysis of HRV showed a decrease in low-frequency (LF) oscillations in absolute units and high frequency (HF) in absolute and normalized units. It also showed increases in LF oscillations of blood pressure. Nonlinear analysis showed a reduction in approximate entropy (ApEn) and in Poincare Plot parameters (SD1 and SD2), accompanied by increases in detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) parameters $\alpha$1 and $\alpha$2. However, we did not find differences in cardiovascular autonomic modulation parameters and BRS in relation to cardiorespiratory fitness neither before nor after the cardiopulmonary test. We concluded that cardiorespiratory fitness does not affect cardiovascular autonomic modulations after cardiopulmonary exercise test, unlike HR recovery.},

abstract={The present study sought to expand upon prior investigations of the relationship between post-exercise heart rate recovery (HRR) and cardiovagal resting-reactivity modulation. HRR from 1st to 5th min after maximal exercise test was correlated with a cardiovagal index of heart rate variability (SD1) at resting (supine and orthostatic positions) and its reactivity after the orthostatic stress test in 34 healthy women. Statistical analysis employed non-parametric tests with a p-value set at 5{\%}. HRR, ∆{\%}HRR, and coefficient of HRR (CHRR) at the 3rd and 5th min correlated with SD1 and SD1n (normalized units) in the supine position (rs{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.36 to 0.47; p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.01). From the 1st to 5th min, HRR, ∆{\%}HRR, and CHRR correlated with SD1 and SD1n in the orthostatic position (rs{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.29 to 0.47; p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}{\thinspace}≤{\thinspace}0.01 to 0.05), except for HRR at 5th min with SD1n (p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.06). Following the orthostatic stress test, HRR at 3rd and HRR, {\%}∆HRR at 5th min correlated with ∆absSD1 (rs{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.28 to 0.35; p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.02 to 0.05). All HRR measurements at 1st min correlated with ∆absSD1n (rs{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.32 to 0.38; p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.01 to 0.03), and the CHRR at 1st min correlated with ∆{\%}SD1(rs{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.37; p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.01). After the sample was divided into high and low cardiovagal modulation subgroups, the subgroup with high modulation at rest (supine and orthostatic) and higher cardiovagal reactivity (reduction) showed faster HRR (p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}{\thinspace}≤{\thinspace}0.01 to 0.05; ES:0.37 to 0.50). HRR throughout the 1st to 5th min positively correlates with cardiovagal modulation in the orthostatic position, and the 3rd and 5th min positively correlate with cardiovagal modulation in both postures at rest. Faster HRR following the maximal exercise test is associated with high resting-reactivity cardiovagal modulation in healthy women.},
