abstract = {Abstract Effluents resulting from fish farming activities can alter the structure and functioning of benthic ecosystems. In Norway, recent technological advances within the salmon industry have facilitated the expansion of aquaculture into shallower locations, leading to additional pressures upon coastal habitats. Maerl/rhodolith beds are important bioengineers in coastal waters—supporting highly diverse associated macrofaunal communities—and are likely to be particularly at risk. This study aims to investigate the environmental changes induced by fish farms in their vicinity and their impact on the structure and functioning of maerl bed macrofaunal communities. High dissolved nutrients and organic enrichment levels were observed close to the cages, associated with lower live maerl cover. Overall, the most substantial impact of salmon farms on macrofaunal communities was observed within 100 m from the cages. Nevertheless, changes in the structure and functioning of assemblages were evidenced up to 300 m. In the vicinity of the cages, communities were characterized by the dominance of endobenthic subsurface deposit feeders and opportunistic species, notably the polychaetes Chaetozone sp., Capitella sp. and Scoloplos armiger. Conversely, sites situated farther away from the cages exhibited higher abundances of epibenthic taxa, including crawlers, grazers and species sensitive to organic enrichment. Sites unaffected by the presence of fish farms were described by high abundances of the ophiuroid Ophiura robusta, the polychaete Proclea graffi and ostracods, reflecting more favourable environmental conditions. Such changes in macrofaunal communities highlight the vulnerability of maerl beds to the impacts of aquaculture, thus emphasizing the importance of rigorous site selection when establishing new fish farming facilities.},

abstract = {Using a unique dataset, this paper investigates factors influencing production loss in Norwegian salmonid farming. The factors can be grouped into fish-specific factors (e.g. species, genetics, and generation), input factors (e.g. vaccines and smolt quality), environmental factors (e.g. geographical location), and managerial factors (e.g. ownership). The most important result is most likely that production losses to a large extent are explainable, as our best model has an R2 as high as 0.826. This implies that it is possibile to reduce production losses significantly. For the specific factors, vaccines reduce production loss, but their effect varies by production site. Production loss also varies with which smolt plant is providing juvenile fish, indicating that there is systematic quality variation among the providers of smolt. There is also significant variation in production loss between companies and production sites, and on average production losses are lower for larger companies and sea sites holding larger numbers of fish. An important point is that while some factors explaining production loss are controlled by the individual company, others are beyond their control. Some of these external factors are related to the regulatory system.}

    abstract = { The conditions encountered by Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., in aquaculture are markedly different from the natural environment. Typically, farmed salmon experience much higher densities than wild individuals, and may therefore have adapted to living in high densities. Previous studies have demonstrated that farmed salmon typically outgrow wild salmon by large ratios in the hatchery, but these differences are much less pronounced in the wild. Such divergence in growth may be explained partly by the offspring of wild salmon experiencing higher stress and thus lower growth when compared under high-density farming conditions. Here, growth of farmed, wild and F1 hybrid salmon was studied at contrasting densities within a hatchery and semi-natural environment. Farmed salmon significantly outgrew hybrid and wild salmon in all treatments. Importantly, however, the reaction norms were similar across treatments for all groups. Thus, this study was unable to find evidence that the offspring of farmed salmon have adapted more readily to higher fish densities than wild salmon as a result of domestication. It is suggested that the substantially higher growth rate of farmed salmon observed in the hatchery compared with wild individuals may not solely be caused by differences in their ability to grow in high-density hatchery scenarios. }
